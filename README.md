# FirstProject
First Project for RCB

This the first project put together by Benjamin Evans, Steve Harrold, Saji Muller and John Joyce. Here we created a website
that allows you to search and keep track of your favorite movies, view trailers or clips of them and get tickets to a 
theater near you.

Front end design was done by Benjamin Evans and Saji Muller. Functionality and back end was done by Steve Harrold.
